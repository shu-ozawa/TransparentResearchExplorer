"feat: Added initial query input form component

- Created QueryInputForm.js component with CSS styling
- Integrated component into HomePage
- Updated App.js to display the new component
- Set up basic npm project and dependencies
- Started development server for testing

This implementation follows the requirements from requirement_definition.md, particularly section 2.1 which mentions "初期キーワード/研究テーマの入力フォーム" (initial keywords/research theme input form).

The next steps would be to:
1. Update handleKeywordsSubmit function in HomePage.js to start the research process
2. Connect to Gemini API for related query generation
3. Display generated queries and allow user editing
